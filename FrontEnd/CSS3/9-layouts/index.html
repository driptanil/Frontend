                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language
                 used for describing the presentation of a document 
                 written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is
                  a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, 
                  alongside HTML and JavaScript.
            </p>

            <p>
                CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation
                 and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] 
                 This separation can improve content accessibility;
            </p>
         </div>
         <div class="clear"></div>
         <div class="box3">
            <p>
                Separation of formatting and content also makes 
                it feasible to present the same markup page in 
                different styles for different rendering methods
